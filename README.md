# Assessing the Path to Improved Water and Sanitation Access in Urban Areas

By analyzing the historical data of a handful of countries given in our dataset from the years 1990 to 2023 to see the difference in improved water and sanitation access and how it has changed over the years. This project provides data driven insights that can inform decision making and contribute to efforts aimed at improving urban living conditions and public health worldwide

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

How has the gap between water and sanitation coverage in urban areas evolved over time, and can total improved water and sanitation be above 90% by 2028?

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

Overall Trends:
The line plot of average improved water, sanitation, and total access over time shows fluctuating trends. While there was a general increase in the most recent years shown (2020-2023), the period between 1990 and 2020 displayed dips, particularly in improved water and total access. Improved water access consistently remained higher than improved sanitation access throughout the observed period.

Insights from Selected Years Bar Plot:
The bar plot comparing average access levels across selected years (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2023) highlights the fluctuations in progress. It clearly shows that improved water access was significantly higher than improved sanitation access in all selected years. The 'total' access metric generally followed the trend of improved water due to its higher values.

Analysis of the Gap:
The analysis of the gap (Improved Sanitation - Improved Water) revealed a predominantly negative gap, indicating that improved water access was generally higher than improved sanitation access. The average gap over the period analyzed was approximately -30.28 percentage points. The year with the largest positive gap was 2002 (1.55 percentage points), while the year with the largest negative gap was 2001 (-51.95 percentage points).

Interpretation of Historical Data:
Based on the historical data, progress in improving water access appears to have outpaced that of improved sanitation access in urban areas across the included geographies. The significant and mostly negative gap suggests a disparity in the development of these two crucial services. While there have been periods of growth, the trends also indicate inconsistencies and even declines in access levels in certain years.



## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

Data collected using various tools and methodologies (e.g, Demographic & Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and Malaria Indicators Surveys)
To accomplish this we performed a time series forecast at an annual level for future time periods from data given fromm 1990-2023 to 2028 for each geography in the dataset "water_and_sanitation_rates.csv". Identify which geographies fall above and below a 90% goal line for the year 2028. Optionally, attach characteristics of the geography/country from the dataset and identify statistically significant characteristics that group or predict falling above or below the line. Summarize the findings, including a list of geographies predicted to be above and below the 90% goal line and the characteristics that are significantly associated with each group.
